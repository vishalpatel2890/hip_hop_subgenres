# Identifying Subgenres in Hip Hop
 
Hip hop music has been evolving constantly since its inception in the early 1980s. Different styles of rapping and music production have developed through time and have been influenced by many factors including locale, political climate, economics, technology, as well as other pop culture. As a result, music labeled as hip hop is very diverse and the label does very little to inform  the listener. In this analysis, I look to develop imperical metrics of different hip hop songs to use as features for clustering to indentify sub-genres(clusters) of hip hop music that share similar lyrical and musical properties.
